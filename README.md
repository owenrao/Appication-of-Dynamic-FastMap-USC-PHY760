## Abstract
Visualizing data not only creates fascinating pieces of art but also greatly supports human-in-the-loop decision-making. Shapes and colors from static graphs as well as even motions from dynamic graphs can help the audiences to understand the dimensions within seconds. However, it becomes extremely harder for people to summarize the essence when it comes to a dynamic network, which involves tens and thousands of nodes and even more edges. With the help of Dynamic FastMap, which efficiently embeds dynamic graphs in Euclidean space, we are able to visualize the change over time in large-scale community networks. This will provide insights into community evolvement patterns and also open up space for geometric and analytical methods.
